# Ki
This is a command-line script designed to make reading, writing and editing such as multi-file creative works (including those with complex directory structures) such as indexes, glossaries, and hypertext fiction from the command-line much easier. See key `ki -h` or `ki --help` for more information. Also see the webpage for Ki: http://ki.growspice.com
