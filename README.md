# Ki
This is a command-line program designed to make reading, writing and editing such as multi-file creative works (including those with complex directory structures) such as indexes, glossaries, and hypertext fiction from the command-line much easier. See `ki -h` or `ki --help` for more information. Also see the webpage for Ki: http://ki.growspice.com

To install do `git clone https://github.com/kumoshk/ki; cd ki; sudo python3 ki -u; python3 ki --xload xscheme.ki`, and follow the prompts (omit `sudo` if you're on Termux or want a local installation).
